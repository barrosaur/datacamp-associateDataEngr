  <li>The average columns should contain the average of the <code>todep</code> (PHQ-9 test), <code>tosc</code> (SCS test), and <code>toas</code> (ASISS test) columns for each length of stay, <strong>rounded to two decimal places</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <code>count_int</code> column should be the number of international students for each length of stay.</li>
  <li>Sort the results by the length of stay in <strong>descending order</strong>.</li>
