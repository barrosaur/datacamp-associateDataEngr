# Go with the flow
To understand what data engineers do, why they are necessary and the impact they have, you need to know how data flows through an organization.

Can you order the four steps of the data science workflow chronologically?
<ol>
  <li>Data collection and storage</li>
  <li>Data preparation</li>
  <li>Exploration and visualization</li>
  <li>Experimentation and prediction</li>
</ol>

# Not Responsible
You recently joined the data science team as a manager for a music streaming company named Spotflix. It's a music platform that lets users stream songs, create playlists, follow artists, watch music videos and even look up lyrics!

One of your colleagues just walked to your desk. They just got hired, but they already know you're on the data team - after training with DataCamp, you've made a name for yourself pretty quick! They have a bunch of data tasks they need completed, and they want to make sure they ask the right person. You tell them you can help them identify what they should request from data engineers, and what they should not.

Can you deliver on this promise?

## Instructions:
Here are several tasks related to working with data. Classify them in two buckets: one for data engineering tasks, one for tasks that are not the responsibility of data engineers.
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Data Engineering Task</th>
      <th>Not a Data Engineering Task</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Optimizing the customers database for analysis</td>
      <td>Based on their listening behavior, predict which songs customers are likely to enjoy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ensuring corrupted, unreadable music tracks are removed and don't end up facing customers</td>
      <td>Building visualization to understand listening patterns by city</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gathering music consumption data from desktop and mobile sources</td>
      <td>Running an experiment to identify the optimal search bar positioning in the app</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

# Big time
You saw how the advent of big data increased the demand for data engineers. As more data gets generated, at a higher rate, with a growing variety of formats, the need for people able to manage this data is soaring.

Which of the following statements are true, and which are false?
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>True</th>
      <th>False</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Data types refer to the data</td>
      <td>Velocity refer to how big the data is</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value refers to how actionable the data is</td>
      <td>Veracity refers to how frequently the data is generated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Volume has to do with how trustworthy the data is</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
